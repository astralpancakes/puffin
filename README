Puffin is a collection of useful stuff for writing OpenGL programs, with a longer term aim of expanding into a tool for "creative coding", similar to Processing.org, Cinder and OpenFrameworks. It strives to conform to OpenGL 3.x.

Puffin is being developed in C on top of SDL, and makes use of GLEW to load OpenGL extensions.

Puffins are my favourite birds, after blue tits.
